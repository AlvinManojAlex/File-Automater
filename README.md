# File-Automater
This Python script allows a user to efficiently automate and store files in the downloads folder into appropriate sub categories.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository and clone it onto your system
2. Locate your Download directory and copy the full path *(Example- C:\Users\KanyeWest\Downloads)*
3. Paste this path in the src variable
4. Run the program and it will automatically categorise your Downloads folder.

## Some Helpful Tips

1. Copy the directory location of the repository into PATH variables in your environment variables.
2. Now you can run the program using the command line as `py fsauto.py` 

*(Note: Ensure you have put directory location to PATH)*
